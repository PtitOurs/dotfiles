# PtitOurs's dotfiles

> ### Why would I want my dotfiles on GitHub?
> * **Backup**, **restore**, and **sync** the prefs and settings for your toolbox. Your dotfiles might be the most important files on your machine.
> * **Learn** from the community. Discover new tools for your toolbox and new tricks for the ones you already use.
> * **Share** what you've learned with the rest of us.
